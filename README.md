**The ultimate tool for converting any webpage into clean, portable, and beautifully formatted Markdown.**

Tired of cluttered web articles, ads, and pop-ups? Web 2 Markdown Pro intelligently extracts the core content from any URL and converts it into a pristine Markdown file, ready for your note-taking app, static site generator, or personal archive.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **One-Click Conversion**: Simply paste a URL and get clean Markdown in seconds.
- **Robust Content Extraction**: Powered by `trafilatura`, it intelligently finds the main article content, filtering out ads, navbars, and other noise.
- **Advanced Fetching System**: If one method fails, it automatically tries two fallback methods (`requests` and a full browser simulation via `DrissionPage`) to handle even the most stubborn JavaScript-heavy sites.
- **Powerful Image Handling**:
  - **Download Images**: Automatically download all images to a local folder and update the links.
  - **Keep Original Links**: Retain the original image URLs.
  - **Strip Images**: Remove all images for a text-only experience.
- **Batch Processing**: Convert a whole list of URLs from a `.txt` file in one go, perfect for large archiving tasks.
- **Automatic Table of Contents (TOC)**: Generates a clickable TOC for articles with headings, making navigation a breeze.
- **YAML Frontmatter**: Includes a clean `---` header with title, source URL, and conversion date, perfect for Obsidian, Jekyll, Hugo, and other platforms.
- **Link Cleaner**: Automatically removes tracking parameters (like `utm_source`) from hyperlinks.
- **Modern UI**: A clean, intuitive interface built with CustomTkinter, featuring:
  - Light & Dark Modes
  - Conversion History Dropdown
  - Progress Bar and Status Updates
  - Word & Character Count
